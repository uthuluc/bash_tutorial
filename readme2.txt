No, there is only one thing worse than having any number of daughters, and that is having a [i]gamer[/i]. Gamers are the most oppressed group, and thus raising a gamer is setting your son up for failure. Of all the options of futures for your children to have, whether it is musclebound man-hulk, or artsy drama auteur, why would you ever choose gamer. That's like choosing villager, or redshirt. You might as well quit before you even began.
